### PROJECTS
**PlayPen**    
A static malware analysis tool which utilize the power of machine learning when making predictions. The project has
three parts: a disassembler which translates a given executable into an intermediary machine code, a prediction
engine that utilize several algorithms to make a prediction whether the executable is malicious or not and a web
interface that generates output logs for the file scanned. A project of 3 people, won CSFair 2019 Data Science Award

**dadam**  
dadam is a j-rpg game engine that lets users to create their own games with little or no programming at all. The user
can either drag and drop visual elements or use the logical programming language embedded within the system. The
project utilizes Java's primitive graphics library. A project of 5 people

**genre-classifier**  
genre-classifier lets users to predict the musical genre of a given song. The dataset consisted several preprocessed
features such as the frequency and the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. The model was trained with SVMs and
neural networks, and LDA was used for dimensionality reduction. Every single algorithm was written from scratch. A
project of 2 people

**lucy**  
Lucy is a crossword-solver that is specifically aimed to complete NY Times’ mini crosswords. Uses constraint
satisfaction and similar methods

**gene-tonic**  
gene-tonic is genetic algorithm implementation in Scala for optimizing neural network topology

### EXPERIENCE

Intern - **Invent Analytics** <span style="float: right; ">June 2018-July 2018</span>  
_● Completed ETL regarding tasks by using tools like Python and SQL Express  
● Designed a CNN that is able to generate features from a given image of a particular clothing. The network was able to  
generate features such as the colour of the clothing, whether it contained stripes or not etc.  
● Designed a character-based RNN that can generate song lyrics using Lua and Torch_ 

 
Intern - **Interra** <span style="float: right; ">August 2019-October 2019</span>  
_● Designed an Android application for Google’s Smart Home APIs. The application is also integrated into the Google’s
Actions API, letting users give voice commands from their Android devices_
