Typography is the voice of the written word. The choice of font, weight, and spacing all contribute to how a message is received.

Serif fonts, with their traditional roots, convey authority and gravitas. They carry the weight of history, the seriousness of print media, the credibility of established institutions.

In digital spaces, typography must balance tradition with clarity. Screen readability demands careful attention to size, line height, and contrast.
