When magic numbers and hardcoded strings scatter throughout code, maintenance becomes difficult. Changing a value means finding every instance, checking context, risking inconsistency.

A central configuration file solves this. All constants live in one place. Changes ripple through the system automatically. The structure of the application becomes visible.

This is not just a technical decision—it's a philosophical one. Centralized configuration reflects intentionality. It says: these values matter enough to be explicit.
