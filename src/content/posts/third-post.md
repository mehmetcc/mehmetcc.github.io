Color can distract. Monochrome focuses attention on content, structure, and meaning. When you remove color, you remove a layer of complexity that often obscures clarity.

Black and white are not the absence of color—they are the foundation of all visual communication. They create contrast, establish hierarchy, and guide the eye.

In a monochrome design, every element must be intentional. Shadows, borders, and spacing take on greater importance. The result is often more powerful than a colorful design.
