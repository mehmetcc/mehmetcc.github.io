Animation should serve purpose, not dazzle. Every transition, every hover state, every interaction must feel deliberate and meaningful.

Subtle animations create feedback without distraction. They confirm actions, guide attention, and provide context. The best animations are those you notice only in their absence.

Timing matters. Easing functions that feel natural—like cubic-bezier curves—create interactions that feel responsive rather than mechanical.
