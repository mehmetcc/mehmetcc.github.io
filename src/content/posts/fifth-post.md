Static site generation returns web development to its roots: serving files that already exist, rather than generating them on demand.

The benefits are clear: speed, security, reliability. Pre-built pages load instantly. There's no server to compromise. Content is frozen at build time, ensuring consistency.

Modern static site generators combine these benefits with developer-friendly abstractions. You write content, they generate sites. Simple, elegant, effective.
